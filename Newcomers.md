# FAQ for Newcomers

## Do I need a Mac to make an app?

Short answer: ***YES***.

There are two phases of the iOS app development workflow:
1. Development
2. Publishing the app on the App Store

First and foremost, if your end goal is to publish your app on the App Store, you really do need a Mac for this. If you are *determined* to *not* get a Mac, you may be able to get away with borrowing someone else's or using a Virtual Machine. It might work, but it might also be a massive flaky pain in the neck to make work and to keep working. Or it might never work. **Just get a Mac.**

You don't necessarily need a Mac to do phase 1. You could easily develop it in a VM or use a cross-platform framework, like [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [Xamarin](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin/), or [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Please [be aware of the risks](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/wiki/faq/crossplatform) involved in using a cross-platform framework.

## Which Mac should I buy?

Additionally, you can [search the subreddit from Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2FiOSProgramming+which+mac&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS726US726&oq=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2FiOSProgramming+which+mac&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.21749j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to see all the other times this question has been asked, to get a feel for what you should get.

## Is Xcode usable on a _____?

Again, you can [search the subreddit via Google](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&q=site:reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming+%22macbook%22+OR+%22macbook+air%22+OR+%22mac+mini%22&cad=h) to see what others have said. If your question is more specific, you may post it in the weekly beginner questions thread.

## Do I need a real device to test it on?

Not always. If this is your first app, the simulator is probably sufficient for your testing needs. If you're trying to get serious about iOS development, you should invest in a device no more than 2 years old.

##  What are some good courses or resources to get started?

Here are some courses. Some of them are old, but they're still relevant if you're just a beginner. These are not websites with individual tutorials, but online courses that you work through 'lesson by lesson'. Some of these may also charge money. Additionally, here is a [search of the subreddit](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&q=site:reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming+beginner+tutorials+OR+%22resources%22&cad=h).
